pandas-challenge analysis

One of the most obvious observations throughout the data is that large school suffer in every category. Medium schools have significantly higher scores across the board,
small schools have the highest on average.

To me, the strangest observation is that there is a strong correlation between lower per student budgets and high performance. Not only do we see this in the spending from schools,
all of the top 5 schools by "both passing %" have lower "per student budget" than the bottom 5 schools.

Finally, in every single example reading scores are always the higher than math. Students in every single school visible in presentation have performed better than in math,
usually much better.
